# Ethiopia LSC catalogue
A catalogue for Ethiopian LSC datasets, services and applications. The content of this catalogue is published at intervals at https://ethiopia.lsc-hubs.org.

## Work in progress
The metadata records are currently hosted in a [git repository at Wageningen University](https://git.wur.nl). These records will be moved to this repostitory over the summer of 2023.

## Metadata control file
Records on this repository are stored in the [metadata control file](https://geopython.github.io/pygeometa/reference/mcf/) format (MCF). MCF is a subset of [ISO19139:2007](https://www.iso.org/standard/32557.html), encoded in [YAML](https://www.yaml.io/spec/). An online editor for MCF metadata is available at [https://osgeo.github.io/mdme/](https://osgeo.github.io/mdme/).
